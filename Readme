### About Me
Hi, I'm young ML engineer enthusiastic for exploring and solving real-life complex problems. My ML work is comprised upon stock market, deepfake audio detection, deepfake vedio classification, and prompt based NLP tasks. Mastering python and conducting novel experiments don't led my passion slower rather boosted me always to explore new undiscovered areas and put effort to create meaningful contributions.
