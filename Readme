## About Me
Hi, I'm young ML engineer enthusiastic for exploring and solving real-life complex problems. My ML work is comprised upon stock market prediction, deepfake audio detection, deepfake vedio classification, data scraping, and prompt based NLP tasks. Practicing novel ideas via Python always boosted me to discover novel undiscovered areas and get expertise to add up into meaningful contributions.
